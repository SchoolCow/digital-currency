									<p>
										From this table, we see that the use of digital currencies is very convenient for the average consumer, 
										being <strong>quicker and cheaper than using regular cash</strong>. This impacts society because it will increase technology use, 
										and businesses and banks will have to transition to being online, with the increasing amount of digital currency users.
									</p>

									<p>
										A more negative societal impact is the <strong>large increase in energy consumption</strong>. Bitcoin's network 
										uses 128 GWh (Gigawatt Hours) per day, an <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/how-much-power-1-gigawatt">absurdly large amount</a>, 
										and this is only one of many cryptocurrencies.
										For more details on the environmental implications of such energy usage, you can view the page on 
										<a href="#environment">environmental impacts</a>.

								<h2 class="major">Ethical Concerns</h2>
								<h3>Misuse of digital currency</h3>
								<p>
									One ethical concern of digital currency is that is often misused do to the lack of regulation. 
									Digital currency is the method of choice among criminals, as it is harder to track and regulate.
									This means that digital currency is increasing the amount of <strong>illegal transactions</strong> and <strong>tax evasion</strong>.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/crypto_crime.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Unequal access</h3>
								<p>
									Depending on where you live and your socioeconomic status, some people don't have access to digital currency.
									This is an ethical concern because it is inaccessible to some groups of people, while others are able to enjoy
									the benefits of digital currency freely.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/internet.svg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>As you can see in this map, some areas have less access to internet, meaning they can't use digital currency.</p>
							</article>

							<article id="environment">
								<h2 class="major">Environmental Impact</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/energy_drain.webp" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									The main environmental impact of digital currency is it's energy consumption.
									The increased technology usage does lead to some extra energy usage, but the main problem
									is the creation and mining of cryptocurrencies. In the chart below you can see how Bitcoin's energy usage
									compares to the energy usage of full countries.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/energy_chart.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									As you can see, Bitcoin uses so much energy that it's consumption is comparable to full countries, 
									and with over 15,000 different cryptocurrencies, it is clear that while being convenient, the energy consumption 
									of digital currencies is a big environmental problem.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you're interested in ways to combat this energy consumption problem, check out the <a href="#sustainability">sustainability</a> page,
									where you can learn about ways to reduce the impact of technology on the environment.
								</p>
							</article>

							<article id="sustainability">
								<h2 class="major">Sustainability</h2>
								<p>
									Ignoring the problem of energy consumption, digital currency is a great way to use technology 
									to reduce environmental impact. It has no physical form, so no materials, machinery, and manpower are 
									needed to use them. Additionally, being able to pay online reduces transportation emissions.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/sustainability.jpg" alt=""/></span><hr>
								<h2>The Energy Problem</h2>
								<p>
									There are two main solutions to the energy consumption problem. The first is to implement alternative energy sources. 
									If renewable energy is used to mine cryptocurrencies, there would be no damage to the environment and it would greatly reduce the impacts of technology.
									The other potential solution would be to implement environmental regulations.
								</p>

							<article id="intro">
								<h2 class="major">What is it?</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/digital_currency.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><strong>Digital currency is any currency that is available exclusively online</strong>, meaning it has no physical form, only an associated value.
									Digital currencies are used like normal currencies as a method of payment for goods and services,
								  but some digital currencies have more specific use cases, such as in video game communities, gambling websites, and social networks.
								</p>

								<h2>Types of Digital Currency</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/crypto.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>
								<p>
									This type of digital currency is secured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptography</a>, 
									and is what most people think of when they hear about digital currency. 
						      Some examples of cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin.
								</p>
								<h3>Virtual Currencies</h3>
								<p>
									This type of digital currency is unregulated and controlled by developers. 
									Virtual currencies are very common in video games, with one example being "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox#Items_and_currency">Robux</a>", 
									the currency used in the popular game known as "Roblox".
								</p>
								<h3>Central Bank Digital Currencies</h3>
								<p>
									This type of digital currency is issued and regulated by large banks.
									Central Bank Digital Currency is often used as a replacement to traditional currency
									when paying online.
